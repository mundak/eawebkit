    Changes.  The following API changes have been made in this release:

      - none.

    New features.  The following features have been added in this release:

      - EAAssert.h may be included from a C source file now.  Thanks to Dan
        Brown from EAC Techworks for this change.

    Bug fixes.  The following bugs have been fixed in this release:

      - EAAssert.h only defines __dllexport/__dllimport if the DLL is being
        built on a Microsoft system.  It would fail to compile on a PS3
        system.  Thanks to Arpit Baldeva from Tiburon for this fix.


    Version 1.00.10 - (January 21, 2009)

    Changes.  The following API changes have been made in this release:

      - none.

    New features.  The following features have been added in this release:

      - none.

    Bug fixes.  The following bugs have been fixed in this release:

      - BUG#31441.  Use fixed-sized versions of vsprintf and sprintf in the
        default assert failed handler.  This prevents buffer overruns in the
        event that the length of the message exceeds the size of the buffer.

      - BUG#32336.  Use puts() instead of printf() for outputting the string
        in case the string has a '%' character in it, which causes printf to
        behave unexpectedly.  The expression EAAssert(5%3 == 0) was causing
        this bug to manifest.
