    this package contains proprietary material belonging to Electronic Arts Inc. (EA). 

2.  SIGNED MASTER AGREEMENT REQUIRED.  You must have at least one
    agreement (such as a development contract, evaluation contract or NDA) in place
    with EA governing the relationship between the Licensee and EA, signed by
    authorized persons on both sides. The terms of this DSLA supplement the terms
    of any underlying agreement (e.g., a Product Development Agreement under which
    the Software would be considered EA Development Aid). Unless any such
    underlying agreement specifies exceptions to this DSLA, the terms of this DSLA
    shall control.

3.  LICENSE.  EA grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub
    licensable right to use the Software as specified by the terms of this DSLA,
    and is provided to you for the limited purpose of aiding EA fulfill its
    business needs, either under contract, or as a partner company or individual
    working with EA.

4.  RESTRICTIONS.


    i.   It is expressly forbidden to use this Software in any way to develop any
         products that competes with EAs business. This restriction extends to using any
         other EA tools provided as part of this Software to produce products that
         compete with EAs business.

    ii.  Unauthorized use or Distribution. You may not provide the Software,
         either in part or in whole, to any 3rd party unless required to do so under
         terms of a signed contract with EA, and with the written approval of EA.
         Approval will generally require that such 3rd parties execute contract(s)
         and/or NDA(s) with EA accepting these limitations and others at EAs discretion.

    iii. Reverse Engineering. You may not and you agree not to, or to enable
         others to, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the
         source code of, decrypt, modify, create derivative works of portions of the
         Software provided only in object code form, or any part thereof (except as and
         only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or
         to the extent as may be permitted by licensing terms governing use of
         open-sourced components included with the Software). Any attempt to do so is a
         violation of the rights of EA and its licensors of the Software.


5.  3RD PARTY LICENSES.  Some portions of this Software may be provided
    under other licenses. You are responsible for complying with all such license
    terms. Details of such licenses, if any, may be found in the accompanying
    3RDPARTYLICENSES.txt file. Any such licenses do not change the terms of this
    license as applied to Software that is the sole property of EA. If the rights
    granted by any such 3rd party licenses are in conflict with the terms of this
    DSLA, then all rights granted under this DSLA are terminated, and you must
    inform EA immediately of such conflict.

6.  COMBINATION WITH SOFTWARE UNDER OTHER LICENSES.  Combining this
    Software with other Software under different license(s), but not provided by
    EA, does not change your rights with respect to Software provided by EA. This
    is the case even if you are directed by EA to obtain such Software and create
    such a combination for use by you. In particular, some tools or server
    executables intended to be used by you but not distributed to others, may
    require you to obtain other Software licensed under various terms, including,
    for example, GPL terms, in order to compile and use the Software. The licenses
    of such Software do not extend to EA owned Software. If a conflict between this
    clause and the terms of any such 3rd party Software obtained by you occurs, you
    must cease activity that causes the conflict and inform EA of the conflict.
    Failure to do this constitutes a breach of this DSLA, and will result in
    immediate termination.
