<h1>EAMessageDefer</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>EAMessageExtra provides additional optional functionality on top of EAMessage related to delayed message delivery beyond the message posting functionality present in the EAMessage Server. Three classes are currently provided:</p>
<blockquote>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Class</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>DeferredMessage</td>
      <td> Implements a message that is sent after a given amount of time. This is like a posted message but the delivery doesn't just occur upon the next message management cycle but instead after a certain amount of time or events (e.g. vblanks).<br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>ThreadSafeCallback</td>
      <td> Implements a callback that is done via EA::Callback but the callback occurs in the main thread instead of the Callback thread. A primary use of this is to allow a system to receive callbacks in a thread-safe way because Callback may occur outside the main thread but the recipient wants the callback to occur in the main thread.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>CallbackMessage</td>
      <td> Implements a Callback (EA::Callback) that sends or posts a callback event to a given recipient instead of a calling a member function. A primary use of this is to allow a system to receive Callbacks via messaging instead of via a specific member function. This allows some systems to be written in a more generic way and have reduced dependencies, assuming those systems are already messaging-savvy.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>ThreadSafeCallback:</p>

///
/// Implements a callback that is done via EA::Callback but the callback

///
/// Since this class works by transferring information from one thread to
/// another, the precision of this callback is necessarily lower than
/// when using EA::Callback directly.
///
/// This class is a subclass of IHandlerRC because this class needs to be a
/// message handler itself and because the asynchronous nature of this 
/// functionality requires reference counting in order to work as desired.

///    ThreadSafeCallback* pThreadSafeCallback = new ThreadSafeCallback;
///    pThreadSafeCallback->AddRef();  // AddRef for our own ownership.
