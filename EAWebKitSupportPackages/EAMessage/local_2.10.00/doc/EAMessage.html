<h1>EAMessage</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>EAMessage is an intra-application messaging system which fundamentally implements the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">observer pattern</a>. </p>
<p>The two fundamental elements of EAMessage are the observers (class IHandler) and the server (class Server). There are additional classes and utilities that provide extended functionality. We will discuss the primary messaging functionality in this document, and address the extended functionality in its own documents, such as <a href="EAMessageExtra.html">EAMessageExtra</a> and <a href="EAMessageDefer.html">EAMessageDefer</a>.</p>
<h2>Design Considerations</h2>
<h3>Messages are void*</h3>
<p>There are many views on how to implement event or messaging systems. A fundamental design aspect of EAMessage is that messages are void pointers and that it is up to the users to agree upon the meaning of the data. This allows for a simpler and more flexible implementation. This design is controversial with some, due to its lack of inherent type safety. However, years of experience with EAMessage-style messaging has shown it to not be an issue in practice. </p>
<h3>Messages are pushed </h3>
<p>Events in a given event system can be pushed, pulled, or polled. The differences are described here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pushed: The system calls the receivers directly with delivered messages. This is like your postman delivering a package to your door. </li>
  <li>Pulled: The receivers ask the system to give them messages. This is like going to the post office to pick up a package. </li>
  <li>Polled: The receivers ask the system if there are any messages. This is like phoning the post office and asking about packages for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>EAMessage is fundamentally a pushed messaging system. However, the EAMessage Server class uses a Queue class to implement a message queue and this queue can be used independently of the Server in pulled or polled way. Indeed, the Server itself <em>pulls</em> from the Queue and <em>pushes</em> the resulting messages onto clients. </p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Here we provide a list of fundamental features of EAMessage:</p>
<blockquote>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Feature</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Immediate delivery (a.k.a. message <em>send</em>)</td>
      <td>Messages are routed to their destination immediately. This is the most common messaging mechanism.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Delayed delivery (a.k.a. message <em>post</em>)</td>
      <td>Messages are put into a queue to be delivered at a later designated time. Among other things, this removes the need for clients to be reentrant and thread-safe, but has its downsides as well. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Direct delivery (peer directly to peer)</td>
      <td>An entity can directly send a message to another entity without using a server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Arbitrary sender</td>
      <td>The sender doesn't have to be any special entity; anybody can send a message. Ideally, the sender doesn't have to register messages before the sender can send them. A message with no registered recipients simply goes into the bit bucket.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Multiple event listeners (event subscription)</td>
      <td>Messages get delivered to potentially multiple recipients. In this case the messages are usually better thought of as broadcasted events.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Message listener priority</td>
      <td>A listener can be designated as the first entity or last entity to receive the message, for example.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reentrancy</td>
      <td>You can send messages while you are in the middle of receiving a message, for example. Ditto for other operations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Thread-safety</td>
      <td>Multiple threads can use messaging simultaneously without restriction.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Auditing</td>
      <td>An external entity can listen in on the activity of the system as a passive observer, primarily for debugging.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Private queues (per-thread queues)</td>
      <td>A features which allows messages to be sent to a handler's own queue, which is typically handled within the handler's own thread.</td>
    </tr>

<h2>Example usage </h2>
<p>We provide some basic example usage here, but there is additional example usage in the code and in the unit tests. </p>
<p>Here's an example of setting up a Server in an application:</p>
<pre class="code-example">EA::Messaging::Server gServer;
 
int main(int, char**)
{
    gServer.Init();
    
    EA::Messaging::SetServer(&amp;gServer);
    
    RunApplication();
    
    gServer.Shutdown();
};</pre>
<p>Here's an example class that registers to receive messages with the message Server:</p>
<pre class="code-example">const uint32_t kTouchdownScored = 0x12345678;
 
struct TouchdownData {
    int mHomeScore;
    int mAwayScore;
};
 
class Listener : public EA::Messaging::IHandler {
public:
    void Init() {
        gServer.AddHandler(this, kTouchdownScored, false);
    }
 
    void Shutdown() {
        gServer.RemoveHandler(this, kTouchdownScored);
    }
 
    bool HandleMessage(EA::Messaging::MessageId id, void* pMessage) {
        if(id == kTouchdownScored) {
            const TouchdownData* const pTD = (TouchdownData*)pMessage;
            printf(&quot;Touchdown was scored. New score is %d : %d&quot;, );
        }

        return true;
    }
};</pre>
<p>Here's an example of sending a message: </p>
<pre class="code-example">void Simulator::Simulate() {
    if(playerPosition &gt; 100) {
        TouchdownData td = { gHomeScore, gAwayScore + 6; }
 
        gServer.MessageSend(kTouchdownScored, &amp;td);
    }
}</pre>
<h2>Interface</h2>
<p>We list the fundamental entities defined by the EAMessage interface. There are some additional functions and definitions which you can see by reading the header file itself. <a href="EAMessageExtra.html">EAMessageExtra</a> and <a href="EAMessageDefer.html">EAMessageDefer</a> have additional functionality.</p>
<p>Priority:</p>
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-example-comment">/// enum Priority
/// This enumeration defines messaging system priorities. In practice, priorities are implemented
/// simply as signed integers whereby higher values denote higher priority. As such, this enumeration
/// is more of a placeholder than a set of values that must be adhered to.
</span>enum Priority
{
    kPriorityAny    = -9999,    <span class="code-example-comment">/// This is a special value used to mean to match any priority during a RemoveHandler call.</span>
    kPriorityLow    = -1000,
    kPriorityNormal =     0,
    kPriorityHigh   =  1000
};
</pre>
<p>IMessageRC:</p>
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-example-comment">/// IMessageRC
///
/// Provides an interface for reference counted messages. Only queue (delayed)
/// messages need to be IMessageRC objects. Regular sent messages can be of any
/// type of object, including IMessageRC objects.
///
/// Instances of this interface need to be created via some kind of heap and 
/// cannot be created on the stack. This is because their lifetime is 
/// necessarily indeterminate. However, such objects can be located in a special
/// nonfragmenting fixed size heap in order to optimize their allocation.

<p>IHandler:</p>
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-example-comment">/// IHandler
///
/// Defines a base class that can process messages. A user would register
/// such a class with a an entity which generates or distributes messages;
/// Normally this is the Server class. However, IHandler instances can be 
/// used outside of the Server class, including the case whereby some piece
/// of code simply directly calls the HandleMessage function of an IHandler.
///
/// The return value usage of the IHandler::HandleMessage function is user-defined.
/// The Server class does not use this return value, but other users of the 
/// IHandler may do so. The return value is used in some systems to indicate
/// whether the handler handled the message or not.
///
/// Note that the HandleMessage function doesn't have a mechanism to identify 
/// the message sender nor other information such as a timestamp. The reason
/// for this is that history has shown that 95+% of the time the message 
/// recipient either doesn't care about who sent the message, or always knows
/// who sent it because there is only one sender. Thus sender identification is 
/// something that should be added to the Message subclass on an as-needed basis.
/// As for time stamps and other similar metadata, history has shown that this 
/// is best handled in the message server in an application-specific way, as there
/// is no single type of metadata that all users want or need.
