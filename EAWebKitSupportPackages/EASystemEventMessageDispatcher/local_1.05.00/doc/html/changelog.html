<h1>EASystemEventMessageDispatcher - Change Log</h1>

This document lists the changes for each EASystemEventMessageDispatcher release and the work we
are currently doing.

<h3>Version 1.05.00</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Moved IEASystemEventMessageDispatcher module into EASystemEventMessageDispatcher package.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.04.04 - October 1st, 2019</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed compiler issues in unit tests on some platforms.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.04.03 - March 1st, 2019</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue where the sony platforms were using the null implementation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.04.02 - January 30th, 2019</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Moved EASystemEventMessageDispatcher tests into package</li>
    <li>Updated code to use generic EA_PLATFORM_SONY macro where possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.04.01 - March 17th, 2017</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug in EASEMD's error reporting function which could report multiple failure types when handling just a single error.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where EASEMD could infinitely try to handle messages during shutdown scenarios where sce libraries have been unloaded during message handling.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.04.00 - October 21st, 2016</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Changed the extra debugging messages of EASEMD to be user controlled via the global property 'EASystemEventMessageDispatcher.Debug=true' so teams don't need to rely on only getting EASEMD debug messages if EA_DEBUG is defined. </li>
    <li>Teams  may disable Companion libs from being linked against by defining the global property 'EASystemEventMessageDispatcher.IncludeCompanionLibs=false'. By default this value is true (Companion libs will be linked against).</li>
	<li>Updated Build and Initialize scripts to remove warnings generated by Framework 3.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.03.07 - September 23rd, 2015</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Converted initialize.xml to structured-XML which fixes warnings generated by Framework.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.03.06 - May 4th, 2015</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Removed large buildtime warning text regarding an issue on firmware 1.030.001 which is a firmware version which is no longer in use.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.03.05</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Corrects EASEMD to not throw an error when there is no event in the message queue for the SceSsystemService, as this is a common expectation.</li>
    <li>EASEMD will now only pump Sony event message queues if there is a MessageHandler registered with EASEMD which can actually respond to the events. This is to prevent missed messages in cases where a user tells SEMD to listen for User messages and calls Tick() but hasn't yet called AddMessageHandler(..., kGroupUserService).</li>
</ul

<h3>Version 1.03.04</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Minor fix to build file for how the DynamicLibrary build type is determined.</li>
</ul

<h3>Version 1.03.03</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed DLL linking issues.</li>
</ul>  

<h3>Version 1.03.02</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Fixes enum type definition which is invalid for VS 2010</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.03.01</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>

<h5>Features</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Allows users to specify how EASEMD is Tick()'d by specifying which message type as a parameter to the Tick() function. Users may now look for only events from certain systems even though they might be registered to more than one at a given time</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.03.00</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
    <li>There is an expectation for users to use Kettle FirmWare 1.030.001 or higher when using this release. This is due to a recent fix in Sony's User Management code. Formerly, User events in queue would be destroyed whenever sceUserServiceGetLoginUserIdList() was called which could result in teams missing login events. This has been fixed with the latest Firmware since there is no define for us to determine version number, the initialization code that was required for verions previous to 1.030.001 has been removed since it would create duplicate user events on the latest version.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.02.00</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>

<h5>Features</h5>
<ul>
  <li>EASEMD now depends on an interface package, IEASystemEventMessageDispatcher.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.01.01</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>

<h5>Features</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Adds HasTicked() function to determine if EASEMD has already updated it's state. This is useful for checking to see if EASEMD has ticked before you have registered any handlers with it, in which case you can never be sure if you lost some events or not.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.00.00</h3>
<h4>Changes</h4>

<h5>Features</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Initial package creation. Simple documentation created.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
</ul>
