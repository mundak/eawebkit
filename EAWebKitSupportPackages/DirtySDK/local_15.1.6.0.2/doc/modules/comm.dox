    \Description
        The Comm module provides packet-level communications protocols.

        <b>Overview</b>

        The Comm module provides a unified calling structure as well as unified
        status and error values for a collection of transport protocols.  Currently
        supported are TCP and a reliable UDP implementation, however, the TCP
        implementation exists for demonstration purposes only and should not be used
        otherwise.
